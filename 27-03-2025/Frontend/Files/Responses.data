Vineet Singh: python -u "c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive\Desktop\27-03-2025\frontend\GUI.PY"
Sanjeevni: It seems like you're trying to run a Python script using the command prompt or terminal. Here's a breakdown of the command:
* `python`: This is the command to run the Python interpreter.
* `-u`: This option forces the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered. This can be useful for debugging purposes.
* `"c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive\Desktop\27-03-2025\frontend\GUI.PY"`: This is the path to the Python script file you want to run. The quotes are necessary because the path contains spaces.
When you run this command, Python will execute the script file `GUI.PY` located in the specified directory.
Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the Python executable is in your system's PATH environment variable.
